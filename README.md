# Statistics-Hypothesis-Testing-project


# Project Overview
This project is focused on performing basic statistical analysis and hypothesis testing. The goal is to analyze datasets using various statistical methods to derive insights and validate or reject hypotheses.

# Key Features and Analysis
- 1. Statistical Analysis
Descriptive Statistics: Calculation of mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, and other summary statistics.
Data Visualization: Use of histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and other visual tools to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
- 2. Hypothesis Testing
Null and Alternative Hypotheses: Formulation of hypotheses based on the problem statement.
- t-Tests: Performing one-sample and two-sample t-tests to compare means.
- Chi-Square Tests: Performing chi-square tests for independence and goodness-of-fit.
- ANOVA: Analysis of variance to compare means across multiple groups.
- p-Value Calculation: Interpretation of p-values to determine the significance of results.
